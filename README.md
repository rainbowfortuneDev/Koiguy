# interviewQA
//100% Test Coverage
Achieving a high test coverage rate is crucial for ensuring the reliability and robustness of the application because it will prevent unexpected errors.
In my last project, we used four different coverage metrics, like function, state, line, and branch coverage.
You know, reaching 100% coverage in any one of these metrics may be manageable, but achieving completeness across all four metrics was a challenge.

1. Writing Unit Tests:
To do this, first of all, we began by writing unit tests for individual components and functions using Jest.

2. Implementing Integration Tests:
While unit tests verified the functionality of individual parts, integration tests helped us confirm that these parts worked correctly when combined. For instance, we tested the interactions between components, and this ensured data flow and event handling worked as expected.

3. Mocking & Stubbing:
One challenge with testing was managing external dependencies, like API calls. 
Using Jest’s robust mocking capabilities, we simulated API responses, databases, and other external services, and this ensured our tests were deterministic and could run even in environments without network access.

4. Continuous Integration (CI):
Besides that, to make sure our test case was consistently run, we integrated it into our CI pipeline—I mean, Bitbucket. 
Every code push or pull request triggered the Jest tests automatically, and this ensured that no code got merged without passing all tests.

5. Monitoring Test Coverage:
Also, we integrated 'Istanbul' tools for providing detailed coverage reports. This helped us identify any gaps in our tests.


//Agile Team Environment
In my previous role, our team adopted Agile methodologies to ensure more efficient work processes.
We had regular daily standup meetings and sprint meetings, which allowed us to stay updated on each other's progress and address any issues that needed to be resolved.
We also had a Demo meeting to showcase our progress and achievements, and we also had a Jira requirement meeting to discuss and clarify project requirements and tasks.
These meetings helped improve open communication and a collaborative atmosphere within the team.
I used several project management tools such as Jira, Kanban, GitHub, and Bitbucket for task tracking, and I also used Global chat apps like Slack and Teamsmeeting for real-time communication in my team.

//Backend Performance Optimization
1. Initial Assessment:
Our journey started with an in-depth assessment of the existing system. We identified bottlenecks, studied the data flow, and evaluated the performance of database queries. This initial assessment highlighted areas that were causing delays and needed optimization.

2. Database Indexing:
One of the first steps we took was to implement database indexing. Given the extensive amount of drilling data, retrieval times were significant. By indexing the appropriate columns, we dramatically reduced the time needed to query the database, especially for the complex and frequently used queries.

3. Query Optimization:
In parallel with indexing, we optimized our database queries. We analyzed the execution plans, identified inefficient queries, and rewrote them to reduce the load on the database. This involved eliminating unnecessary joins, using subqueries judiciously, and leveraging aggregated views where possible.

4. Load Balancing:
Another crucial aspect was implementing load balancing. Given the variability in the load, with spikes in data during specific operations, it was essential to distribute the traffic efficiently across multiple servers. Load balancing enabled us to ensure that no single server bore too much load, thereby improving the overall responsiveness of the system.

5. Caching Strategies:
In addition to these, we also implemented caching strategies for frequently accessed data. This reduced the need to compute the same data multiple times and further decreased the server response times.

It was a rewarding experience to see the tangible benefits of our optimization efforts.

//Bitbucket, Docker, Kubernetes
Absolutely, setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline was important to ensuring the rapid and reliable delivery of our software.

1. Bitbucket:
We used Bitbucket for source control, and it hosted our repositories, providing a platform for code reviews, pull requests, and branching strategies. We utilized feature branches for individual tasks, ensuring the isolation of changes and facilitating parallel development.

2. Docker:
We containerized our applications, bundling them with all their necessary components. This ensured that our applications ran consistently, no matter where we deployed the containers.

5. Integrating CI/CD Tools:
Within Bitbucket, we integrated CI/CD tools to automate the building, testing, and deployment of our applications every time there was a code change. We defined pipeline configurations to specify the sequence of actions to be performed, from code linting to running unit tests with Jest.
Every push to the repository triggered the test suite, ensuring that regressions were identified immediately.

//Challenging Project
I think the most challenging project was an enterprise-level online banking platform called ‘Curo’ for a global banking corporation. 
The goal of this project was to serve millions of users worldwide, execute tens of transactions every second, and provide a range of banking services.
Being the senior software engineer alongside our team leader, I developed this project from scratch, and my responsibilities included constructing an application architecture, developing components, testing, improving performance issues, and reviewing the code.
We built this application using TypeScript version 4.4, React 17.0.2, heavily utilizing React Hooks and Redux, also used Material UI for the UI component, Jest for unit testing, and additionally, we created our own module called 'curo'.

The difficult challenge that I faced was performance optimization because it requires a large number of users and a high volume of transactions.
Challenge: Our platform had to handle a lot of transactional data from various sources like checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, and even third-party integrations. Aggregating this data in real-time while ensuring efficient frontend performance was a challenge. 
We needed to process this data in a way that users could quickly gain valuable insights. They should also be able to explore specific categories, time frames, and other criteria as needed.
Solution: To tackle this issue, I initiated a collaboration with our backend team to structure our database queries and API responses optimally. 
Instead of pulling raw transactional data and processing it on the client side, we focused on moving a lot of the data summarization logic to the backend.
This approach significantly reduced the data payload and processing required on the frontend.
I used memoization techniques in our React components to avoid unnecessary renders. Additionally, by implementing a smart caching mechanism on the frontend, we could store already fetched data segments. This reduced the frequency of API calls, especially when a user toggled between different views or filters. 

Moreover, I also used code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, and Javascript minifying in the whole process. 
These collective efforts led to substantial performance optimization, ensuring our application ran smoothly and efficiently under heavy load.

Besides that, In this project, I addressed other challenges such as responsiveness across various devices, internationalization for the global user base, and maintaining a high standard of code quality. 
The project was successfully launched and received positive feedback from both the banking corporation and its clients.

//Collaborating UI/UX Designers
Collaborating with UI/UX designers was essential to ensuring the designs were visually appealing, technically feasible, and responsive across all devices.
In my last project, we had regular meetings with our designers where they would present their design concepts and user flow diagrams. 
We discussed the feasibility, potential technical challenges, and any performance considerations. This iterative dialogue ensured the final designs were both beautiful and optimal from a development standpoint.
The designs are sometimes changed based on users and customers feedback.
Each time, we had meetings where we had careful discussions, and adjusted the UI to meet customer requirements.
Early in the project, back-end engineers and I engaged in detailed discussions to define the API endpoint. 
These discussions helped outline the data structure, endpoints, and format of requests and responses.


//Collaborating Stakeholders/Clients
1. Initial Meetings & Requirement Gathering:
Our engagement began with a series of meetings with stakeholders and clients. The goal was to understand their main points, aspirations, and the specific inefficiencies they were experiencing. 

2. Analysis & Technical Guidance:
Once we had a clear understanding of the requirements, we conducted a detailed analysis to identify opportunities for improvement. 
Based on this analysis, we provided technical guidance, suggesting innovative solutions and technologies that could address the identified challenges.

4. Iterative Development & Feedback Loop:
The development process was iterative, with regular check-ins with stakeholders and clients. We established a continuous feedback loop, incorporating their insights, and adjusting the solutions as needed. This collaborative approach ensured that the final product was closely aligned with the client's vision and needs.

This close collaboration with stakeholders and clients was instrumental in aligning our technical expertise with their business needs,and, leading to meaningful and impactful solutions. It was rewarding to see the tangible improvements in operational efficiency and the positive feedback from the users

//Designing and Architecting
Designing and architecting our application was very challenging. 
Given the critical nature of financial applications, our main focus areas were security, performance, scalability, and user experience.

1. Initial Analysis and Modular Design:
Before diving into the technical aspects, we thoroughly analyzed the business requirements.
We broke down the entire application into modular components, and this made our application scalable, easier to maintain, and allowed for parallel development.

2. React Best Practices:
We made extensive use of React's functional components and hooks for state management and utilized the Redux for global state management, and also took advantage of React’s lazy loading, suspense, memoization and more, to improve load times.

3. Security:
Since it's a financial project, data protection was very important. We took steps to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks, and also integrated with secure backend APIs that followed the OWASP security guidelines.

4. Scalable CSS Architecture:
For styling, we utilized CSS-in-JS solutions, which gave us component-level styles, ensuring that our UI remained consistent. 
And we also used Material-UI for the UI component.

5. Responsive Design:
To implement the responsive design, we adopted a mobile-first approach. 
This ensured that our financial dashboards and tools were accessible on everything from mobile devices to desktop monitors.
Additionally, from a testing perspective, we used Jest for unit testing and React Testing Library for component-level testing, and CI/CD pipeline tools were set up to ensure that every code push went through a rigorous testing phase.

//Franklin Insurance Experience

Mt Franklin Insurance is an insurance company known for providing specialized insurance products and solutions to insurance brokers, agents, and carriers. 
It is based in El Paso, Texas, and was established in 2010.
Their core services include distribution, underwriting, product development, administration, and risk management.
They focus on solving complex insurance issues with innovation, industry knowledge, and leadership to help brokers, agents, and carriers.

This is my first company, and after completing my university education, I joined Fraklin and started my software career at this company.
I worked as a Junior Frontend developer for around 2 years.
There, I gained a strong background in the core concepts of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I became particularly skilled in Responsive design, seamlessly adapting to various devices and screen sizes. 
Additionally, I've gained experience in React development, so I led the migration process of a legacy frontend application to React, utilizing React's built-in routing and components.


//Feature in last project
Leveraging the power of React's state management, we developed a real-time, interactive dashboard that displayed account balances, recent transactions, and financial insights.
And using CSS Grid and Flexbox, we ensured the platform was fully responsive for adapting across various devices and had a transfer feature, allowing users to send money to others with just a few clicks.
Also, we integrated a bill payment system where users could set up and manage recurring bills, ensuring they never missed a payment.

Besides that, this application included other features like customizable alerts, personal financial insights, security enhancements, and API integrations.

Customizable Alerts: Using React Hooks, we built a feature where users could set up and customize alerts for account activities, ensuring they always stayed informed.

Personal Financial Insights: Integrated data visualization libraries to show users their spending patterns, savings trends, and financial goals in colorful, easy-to-understand charts.

Security Enhancements: Implemented multi-factor authentication and biometric login capabilities, making use of modern browser APIs for added security.

API Integrations: Collaborated with the backend team to seamlessly integrate various microservices, ensuring smooth data flow and transaction handling.



//Migrate from legacy Frontend to React

Absolutely, transitioning from a legacy front-end to React was very important move for our project, particularly focusing on creating a more structured, maintainable, and high-performing application. I will explain this in more details.

1. Assessment and Planning:
We began by thoroughly assessing the existing legacy application, identifying areas of complexity, performance bottlenecks, and features that could benefit from React's capabilities.

2. Component-Based Architecture:
React’s component-based architecture was central to our strategy. We decomposed the existing UI into reusable, encapsulated components, which enhanced maintainability and consistency across the application. This modularity also allowed for parallel development, speeding up the overall transition process.

3. Routing with React Router:
To manage navigation and the rendering of components in our single-page application (SPA), we leveraged React Router. 

4. State Management:
For state management, we evaluated several options and chose a solution that best fit our needs.
We considered Redux and Context API and after the discussion, we chose the Context API because this application was not an enterprise-level application and this ensured that state was managed effectively across components, improving data flow and making the application more predictable and easier to debug.

5. Performance Optimization:
And we utilized React’s virtual DOM to minimize direct manipulation of the actual DOM, reducing re-rendering times. Additionally, we implemented lazy loading, memoization, and optimized key handling for lists, which significantly improved the application’s responsiveness.

6. Testing and Validation:
Also we wrote comprehensive test suites using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library, achieving high test coverage and ensuring the reliability of the application.

This transition was a significant success, resulting in a more structured, maintainable, and high-performing application.




//Full-stack Responsibility
AKM is a gas exploration and production company located in Houston, Texas, and they are providing safe, clean, and reliable natural gas to more than 700,000 customers in 100 communities.
They built the SASS application that could process and analyze real-time data from the drilling operations with around 15 team members.
There, I worked as a React Node full stack developer, and my responsibility was to design and develop applications based on the microservices architecture design patterns using React for the frontend part and Node.js with the serveless framework for the backend.
This involved working closely with the drilling engineers and other stakeholders to understand their needs and requirements and then translating these into technical specifications for the software.
One of my key contributions was the development of a web-based dashboard that allowed the drilling team to monitor drilling data in real-time.
This required me to design and implement a complex data processing pipeline that could ingest large volumes of data from multiple sources and then present this information in a user-friendly and intuitive format.
In addition to this, I was also responsible for maintaining and enhancing the existing applications used by the company, such as a tool for tracking equipment maintenance and a reporting system for compliance with safety regulations. 
This involved debugging and troubleshooting issues, as well as making updates to the codebase to add new features and functionality.

I have an appreciation for the company's work-life balance, culture, and more.
Last company  details
Vaco is an IT service and consulting company that provides a range of services to businesses and organizations.
It has thousands of employees and offers several services, such as technology solutions, staffing, and consulting, with a focus on industries such as healthcare, finance, insurance, and technology.

//Leadership Experience
In my last company, Vaco, that was the time, maybe 2021, when my team leader had to leave our team due to a personal issue.
As a senior software engineer, I have had the opportunity to lead projects and mentor junior developers on my team. 
One particular experience was when I led my team of six developers to create a new feature for our web application.
I was responsible for creating the project plan, setting the timeline and milestones, and coordinating with stakeholders to ensure that everyone was aligned on the project goals. 
Throughout the project, I regularly met with team members to provide feedback, guidance, and support. 
I made sure that each team member had a clear understanding of their responsibilities and that they had the resources they needed to complete their tasks.
In addition to managing the project, I also took on a mentoring role for junior developers on my team. 
I provided guidance on best practices, helped them troubleshoot issues, and encouraged them to take ownership of their work. 
I also conducted code reviews to maintain a strong standard of quality for our codebase.



//Monolithic to Microservices
Honestly, transforming our legacy monolithic server into a microservices architecture was challenging. 
The project’s main goal was to improve our gas drilling marketing platform's efficiency and user experience. 
I will provide a more detailed explanation of how it works.

1. Micro Frontends with React:
For the frontend, we adopted a Micro Frontends approach using React. This enabled us to break down the frontend into smaller, more manageable pieces, each corresponding to a microservice.


2. Backend with Node.js and Serverless  :
On the backend, we used Node.js to build the individual microservices. The serverless framework helped us deploy and manage these services efficiently. This approach allowed each service to scale independently based on demand.

Honestly, I mainly worked on frontend microservice architecture, so I will explain it in more detail.

1. Identifying Boundaries:
The first step was to identify the boundaries for splitting the monolith. We analyzed the existing application, identifying distinct features and functionalities that could be isolated and developed as independent micro-frontends.

2. Designing the Architecture:
Once the boundaries were established, we designed the architecture for the micro-frontends. We defined how they would communicate, share data, and integrate with each other. We also established conventions for code sharing, versioning, and deployment to maintain consistency across the micro-frontends.

4. Leveraging Frameworks and Libraries:
We used React for building the micro-frontends. And after that, we started development to migrated from Monolithis to Microservices.

First of all I created a new config file named webpack.config.js file at the each projects.
There we set the port number, module path, plugins.
And changed the start script in package.json to utilize our webpack config:
 "scripts":{
    "start": "webpack serve"
  }

we needd to add Module Federation to tell our host where to get the components.
In our webpack.config.js we introduce the ModuleFederationPlugin:
Here, we can set the name, remotes, and shared.

Name:- It is used to distinguish the modules.
Remotes:- It is where we define the federated modules we want to consume in this app. here, we can set the port number.
Shared:- It is how we share dependencies between modules. This is very important for React because it has a global state, meaning you should only ever run one instance of React and ReactDOM in any given app. 
plugins: [
   new ModuleFederationPlugin({
     name: "Host",
     remotes: {
       Remote: `Remote@http://localhost:4000/moduleEntry.js`,
     },
     shared: {
       ...dependencies,
       react: {
         singleton: true,
         requiredVersion: dependencies["react"],
       },
       "react-dom": {
         singleton: true,
         requiredVersion: dependencies["react-dom"],
       },
     },
   }),
 ],

After this configuration, we developed each microservice according to its features.
This allowed us to adapt quickly to changing requirements and efficiently deliver high-quality features to our users



//Other Tech stack
I don't think I have extensive experience with WordPress, but during my time at the first company, I gained a solid understanding of the basics of WordPress and its ecosystem. 
I was responsible for creating and customizing WordPress themes, and integrating frontend components.
My primary focus was React-centric development, but I've always maintained an underpinning of WordPress knowledge. 
I've continued to engage with WordPress-related tasks and projects to keep my skills up-to-date.
There is no problem with that.
My proficiency in Vue.js will be 6 out of 10.




//Performance Optimization Detail
As our application required a large number of users and a high volume of transactions every second,  performance optimization was very important.
To tackle this issue, we mainly used Code Splitting, Lazy loading, Memoization, and React useCallback.

1. Code Splitting:
Code splitting is one of the performance optimization techniques that involves dividing JavaScript code into smaller, more manageable chunks.

We realized that bundling all our JavaScript into one file wasn't efficient. This meant that users had to download a lot of code they might never use. Code splitting enabled us to break our code into smaller chunks, which are loaded on demand. This reduced the initial load time and memory usage, which is particularly beneficial for users with slower network connections.

2. Lazy Loading:
Lazy loading is a technique used to improve the performance of a web application by delaying the loading of certain components or resources until they are actually needed. 

Similar to code splitting, lazy loading ensures that components or sections of our application aren’t loaded until they're needed. 
Our app had multiple routes like dashboard, transaction, billing, order, or something like that. With the React.lazy() function, we ensured that the code for a particular route was only fetched when a user navigated to it. This not only sped up the initial page load but also ensured efficient usage of resources.

3. Memoization:
Memoization in React is a performance optimization technique used to improve the efficiency of functional components by caching the results of expensive calculations or function calls.
Reselect is a React library that helps in the efficient computation of data with selectors.

And, also, we used Memoizaiton efficiently, which allowed us to store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occurred again. This prevented unnecessary recalculations and saved valuable processing time. We used the React.memo() function for components and reselect libraries for our Redux selectors to achieve this.

4. Strategic use of React's useCallback:
useCallback is a React hook used for optimizing the performance of functional components by memoizing functions.

And, you know, in React, functions are re-created every time a component re-renders, which can be problematic, especially when passing callback functions as props to child components. If these child components rely on reference equality checks (like with React.memo()), they could unnecessarily re-render. 
useCallback helped us memoize functions, ensuring they don't get re-created unless one of their dependencies changes.

These collective efforts led to subst...



//Recent Technology
Parallel mode in React is a new way to render the interface that allows React to render during the fetching of data.
This is done by breaking down the render into chunks and rendering each chunk independently. 
As each chunk is rendered, React will update the DOM to reflect the new state. 
This allows for a more responsive interface and can improve the overall performance of your application.
I will explain this technology.
To use parallel mode, you need to first enable it in your application. 
You can add the `concurrent: true` command in the index.js file.
Once parallel mode is enabled, you can start rendering your interface using the new rendering model. 
To do this, you need to use the useCallback hook to create a callback function that will be called whenever your data changes. The callback function will then be used to render the new state of your interface.
Parallel mode is a powerful new feature that can be used to improve the performance of your React applications. By breaking down the render into chunks and rendering each chunk independently, React can render your interface while fetching data. This can result in a more responsive interface and an improved overall user experience.

Besides that, I studied other advanced technologies such as Enhanced profiling capabilities, Data annotation, Enhanced server-side rendering and Next.js as well.

Enhanced Profilling capabilities: React DevTools now includes enhanced profiling capabilities that allow developers to analyze and optimize their application's performance.
Data annotation: Annotated data is required to improve apps that use machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Enhanced server-side rendering: This allows developers to render their applications on the server rather than the client. This will improve the performance of applications and allow developers to create more complex applications.






//Migrate from React to Next
In the first six months, I worked on an internal project, the creation of a centralized analytics dashboard.
I collaborated with various departments to develop tools that improved organizational productivity.
But there are some performance issues in our dashboard because it requires various transactions, including daily reports from multiple departments, advertisements, analytics, notifications, task management, and so on.
So, we have decided to migrate this application from React to Next.js to address these performance concerns. 

1. Moving existing React components and Routing
After the creation of the Next.js project, first of all, I moved existing React components into the new project's structure.
Next JS follows the conventions for the pages directory, where each file in this directory becomes a route.
I moved this component to the following location within the new project.

2. Assets and static files
And Next JS has a built-in way of handling assets and static files. In the public directory, you can place images, fonts, and other files, which will be served at the root URL.
I moved all asset files to the proper public directory.

3. Styling
You know, Next JS supports various CSS modules, but I can also continue using our existing styling solution.
So, I copied this file into the new project, imported it, and used it in my components as before.

4. Data fetching and API routes
After that, I needed to fetch the data and do API routing.
Next JS provides built-in support for data fetching using methods like getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and getInitialProps.
I copied this function into the new project and used it with getServerSideProps or getStaticProps.




During this transition, one of the primary challenges I faced was understanding and effectively utilizing the data fetching methods such as getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and the older getInitialProps.
The first issue was deciding which pages should use getStaticProps for Static Site Generation and which ones should use getServerSideProps for Server-Side Rendering.
To tackle this issue, We thoroughly researched our application's pages. 
And, pages with content that didn't change often, like blog posts or documentation, were an ideal choice for getStaticProps. 
On the other hand, pages that required real-time data, like user dashboards and daily reports, were a good choice for getServerSideProps.

I have completed a successful migration of our application, resulting in significant performance improvements.











//Resolving conflict coworkers
In a previous project, a colleague and I had different views regarding the implementation of a particular feature. 
My colleague preferred using an existing React module to save time and leverage community support, and I advocated for building a custom module that would more accurately meet our specific project requirements.
Our discussions were initially intense, given the different perspectives. 
So we proposed a structured discussion to the team where each of us could present our case.
I focused on performance benefits, better control over the code, and the potential for growth and adaptability.
It could also contribute to our team's development skills, even though this might take a bit longer and require more resources
My colleague also made his case, highlighting the time savings, community support, and proven reliability of the existing React module.
After carefully considering all aspects and potential future implications, the team decided to go ahead with the development of a custom module.	
Despite an initial disagreement, my colleague and I collaborated to find a solution. 
This experience brought our team closer, as we appreciated diverse perspectives and kept our project's success in mind. 


//Responsibility in the last position?
I worked as a senior front-end engineer at Vaco for about 3 and a half years.
Here, my main responsibility revolved around constructing an application architecture and developing UI components.

Performance optimization was a critical part of my role.
I optimized our applications to ensure fast loading and smooth operation, even under heavy traffic. 

Maintaining the code quality and responsive design was very important. 
So, I always conducted code reviews and ensured our designs were responsive and would function seamlessly across various platforms.
Additionally, I mentored two junior developers and collaborated with various team members, including back-end developers, designers, and other stakeholders, to ensure our code met the requirements of the business and the end users.
Remote Working Environment
I think there will be pros and cons to each working environment, and it depends on you.
In my case, I prefer a remote working environment because I think remote work environments offer a lot of benefits, if they're managed well. 
They offer flexibility, which can improve work-life balance and also lead to increased productivity because workers can set up their environment in a way that suits their individual needs.
In my past experience, I've successfully worked remotely and that’s what I enjoy. 


//Startup Environment
At Unisys, I mainly worked with one client named First Women’s Bank, a startup banking corporation.
They have around 50 employees, and I was part of a 5-member team and collaborated with them for two years. 
We operated in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.
Every day presented new challenges and opportunities, encouraging a culture of adaptability and innovation. The smaller team size allowed for closer collaboration, enabling us to make quick decisions and adjust our strategies when needed. This agility was crucial in our mission to address the gender gap in access to capital and provide banking solutions for women. The startup atmosphere also cultivated a strong sense of ownership and passion among team members.
